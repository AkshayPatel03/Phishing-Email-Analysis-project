# Phishing Email Analysis and Remediation

## Introduction

Phishing is a cyber attack that involves tricking email recipients into believing that a message is legitimate, often to steal sensitive information. This project focuses on analyzing phishing emails and developing a remediation strategy for a Security Operations Center (SOC).

## Project Objectives

- Analyze phishing emails to identify malicious elements.
- Develop a remediation strategy to respond to phishing incidents.
- Provide a step-by-step guide for SOC analysts to handle phishing incidents effectively.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains sample phishing emails for analysis.
- **scripts/**: Includes scripts for email analysis and automation.
- **reports/**: Generated reports from the analysis.
- **images/**: Visual representations and diagrams.

## Analysis of Malicious Emails

### Step 1: Collecting and Identifying Phishing Emails

SOC analysts collect suspected phishing emails from various sources like user reports, email gateways, and threat intelligence feeds.

### Step 2: Email Header Analysis

Examine email headers to identify suspicious elements such as spoofed addresses, unusual sending patterns, and anomalous metadata.

```bash
# Example script to extract email headers
python3 scripts/extract-email-headers.py data/sample-emails/email1.eml
```
The Python scripts will be in the Scripts repository (File name: extract-email-headers.py)

### Step 3: Email Body Analysis including URL and Attachment Analysis
Analyze the content of the email body for malicious links, attachments, and social engineering tactics for malware and phishing pages.

```bash
# Example script to extract email body Analysis
python3 scripts/analyse-email.py data/sample-emails/cotsco.eml
```
The Python scripts will be in the Scripts repository (File name: analyse-email.py)
